# dotfiles

My dotfiles, very simple but with everything I need.

## i3

Very clean, without polybars or any type of bars. Everything is invisible.

## tmux

Basically tmux, but vim friendly.

## nvim 

Simple nvim settings, supports linting, git, autocomplete. Also works as an agnostic interpreter.
Very useful to code in interpreted languages.
