# dotfiles

My dotfiles, very simple but all I need.

## tmux

Tmux allows me to combine processes, shells and Vim in any way I need for the project at hand. I'm able to build my own IDE-like experience. I'm a big user and huge fan.  
Core to my tmux work is the combination of a plugin that bring Vim & tmux together, [vim-slime](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime) for sending commands from vim to tmux, making possible to code in any language interpreter at the same config.

## nvim 

I use few Vim plugins and don't spend much time customizing them. Usually, I change the other dotfiles to Vim's style. Vim provides a way of editing text that I love, it's not about productivity or speed, it's about being focused and having more freedom to think, when I don't need to worry about the tool, it's easier to focus on what matters.
It currently supports linting, syntax highlighting, autocomplete, git, and has a command-line fuzzy finder, [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

## i3

i3 is fast. It is neither bloated nor fancy. I found it simple and efficient.  
I use with a minimalist configuration, without polybars or anything like that. Everything is invisible, and the commands look like Vim's.
If there are no open windows, you can only see the wallpaper.
